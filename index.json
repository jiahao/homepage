For example, banks must prove that the way that they approve mortgages comply with fair lending laws and promote community development, while at the same time managing risk appropriately. These needs translate directly onto AI/ML solutions being developed for these business needs. In this talk, I introduce two research challenges that arise from the unique mix of business needs and regulatory constraints. First, we develop new methods for measuring bias in decision processes where labels for protected class membership cannot be observed.

Probabilistic models for predicting the protected class based on observable proxies, such as surname and geolocation for race, are sometimes used to impute these missing labels for compliance assessments. Empirically, these methods are observed to exaggerate disparities, but the reason why is unknown. In this paper, we decompose the biases in estimating outcome disparity via threshold-based imputation into multiple interpretable bias sources, allowing us to explain when over- or underestimation occurs. We also propose an alternative weighted estimator that uses soft classification, and show that its bias arises simply from the conditional covariance of the outcome with the true class membership. Finally, we illustrate our results with numerical simulations and a public dataset of mortgage applications, using geolocation as a proxy for race. We confirm that the bias of threshold-based imputation is generally upward, but its magnitude varies strongly with the threshold chosen. Our new weighted estimator tends to have a negative bias that is much simpler to analyze and reason about.","tags":null,"title":"Fairness under unawareness: assessing disparity when protected class is unobserved","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Nathan Kallus","Xiaojie Mao","Geoffry Svacha","Madeleine Udell"],"categories":null,"content":"My intern, Xiaojie Mao, will be presenting his summer research work while at Capital One based on this paper.\n","date":1548788405,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548788405,"objectID":"1c00742e487d991f4e911dec8c1e487d","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2019-01-fatstar/","publishdate":"2019-01-29T14:00:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-01-fatstar/","section":"talk","summary":"My intern, Xiaojie Mao, will be presenting his summer research work while at Capital One based on this paper.","tags":[],"title":"Fairness under unawareness: assessing disparity when protected class is unobserved","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeff Bezanson","Jiahao Chen","Benjamin Chung","Stefan Karpinski","Viral B.

This is evinced by the unusually large number of specialized languages in the area (e.g. MATLAB, R), and the complexity of common software stacks, often involving multiple languages and custom code generators. We believe this is ultimately due to key characteristics of the domain: highly complex operators, a need for extensive code specialization for performance, and a desire for permissive high-level programming styles allowing productive experimentation. The Julia language attempts to provide a more effective structure for this kind of programming by allowing programmers to express complex polymorphic behaviors using dynamic multiple dispatch over parametric types. The forms of extension and reuse permitted by this paradigm have proven valuable for technical computing. We report on how this approach has allowed domain experts to express useful abstractions while simultaneously providing a natural path to better performance for high-level technical code.","tags":null,"title":"Fast flexible function dispatch in Julia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Andreas Noack"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498483800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498483800,"objectID":"2b1df396b00f89a4ad37dc9454d81d27","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2017-07-pasc/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T20:58:31+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-07-pasc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Design choices for numerical linear algebra in a compiled high-level language","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498235700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498235700,"objectID":"862a6ca17460adff03ec4ec2755e9513","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2017-06-juliacon/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T21:04:16+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-06-juliacon/","section":"talk","summary":"from @jiahao: We have really thought carefully about what the transpose of a vector should mean in a programming language. The pre-0.6 behavior that vector’vector yields a vector, vector’ yields a matrix, and vector’’ yields a matrix are all bad mathematics and produced no shortage of confusion by end users. I present a summary of our research at the MIT Julia Labs into issue #4774, as a language design question that is informed by a comprehensive understanding of user expectations. Our main result is a short proof that it is impossible to avoid either new types, “ugly mathematics” (violation of Householder notation) or type instability. A single Array type is incompatible with Householder notation that produces the expected types from typical linear algebraic expressions. Furthermore, Householder notation intrinsically requires a conflation of 1x1 matrices and true scalars. I also provide historical evidence the notion of “ugly mathematics” is neither static nor objective. In reality, linear algebra has changed greatly over the past centuries, demonstrating the impermanence of even elementary concepts of what matrices and vectors are and how they have been influenced by notation - a discussion forced into consciousness through the lens of programming language design, types, and formal program semantics. I review the resolution of #19670 in the context of other designs in other programming languages, showing that all these designs turn out to locally optimal in conflating as much of Householder notation and array semantics as possible.

The Julia type system also allows for bidiagonalizations to be computed over a wide variety of matrix data types, ranging from ordinary dense matrices to sparse matrices with multiprecision floating point numbers. Overloading elementary operators such as multiplication (*) and subtraction (-) allow the same code to run on new data structures, such as out of core arrays in a database, or custom matrix representations. The same technique allows us to provide run time control over the underlying linear algebra library, allowing users to change between OpenBLAS, MKL, Eigen, and others.

Neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) molecular orbital methods provide and intriguing generalization of classical force fields in this regard because they can account both for bond breaking and electronic polarization of molecules. However, we show that most standard NDDO methods fail for water because they give an incorrect description of hydrogen bonding, water's key structural feature. Using force matching, we design a reparameterized NDDO model and find that it qualitatively reproduces the experimental radial distribution function of water, as well as various monomer, dimer, and bulk properties that PM6 does not. This suggests that the apparent limitations of NDDO models are primarily due to poor parameterization and not to the NDDO approximations themselves. Finally, we identify the physical parameters that most influence the condensed phase properties. These results help to elucidate the chemistry that a semiempirical molecular orbital picture of water must capture. We conclude that properly parameterized NDDO models could be useful for simulations that require electronically detailed explicit solvent, including the calculation of redox potentials and simulation of charge transfer and photochemistry.","tags":null,"title":"Why many semiempirical molecular orbital theories fail for liquid water and how to fix them","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Alan Edelman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1416182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1416182400,"objectID":"ed6c1a41f35cc471c1c0a98a4fb0e9df","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2014/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:19.627708Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Polymorphism in programming languages enables code reuse.

Defining this functionality at the user level instead provides greater flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility. In contrast, dynamic languages make it straightforward for the user to define any behavior they might want, but at the possible expense of performance. As part of the Julia language project, we have developed an approach that yields a novel trade-off between flexibility and compile-time analysis. The core abstraction we use is multiple dispatch. We have come to believe that while multiple dispatch has not been especially popular in most kinds of programming, technical computing is its killer application. By expressing key functions such as array indexing using multi-method signatures, a surprising range of behaviors can be obtained, in a way that is both relatively easy to write and amenable to compiler analysis. The compact factoring of concerns provided by these methods makes it easier for user-defined types to behave consistently with types in the standard library.","tags":null,"title":"Array operators using multiple dispatch: a design methodology for array implementations in dynamic languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifeng Wei","Guinevere Mathies","Kenichi Yokoyama","Jiahao Chen","Robert G.

Unlike the class I and II RNRs, where reducing equivalents for the reaction are delivered by a redoxin (thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, or NrdH) via a pair of conserved active site cysteines, the class III RNRs examined to date use formate as the reductant. Here, we report that reaction of the _Escherichia coli_ class III RNR with CTP (substrate) and ATP (allosteric effector) in the absence of formate leads to loss of the G• concomitant with stoichiometric formation of a new radical species and a “trapped” cytidine derivative that can break down to cytosine. Addition of formate to the new species results in recovery of 80% of the G• and reduction of the cytidine derivative, proposed to be 3′-keto-deoxycytidine, to dCTP and a small amount of cytosine. The structure of the new radical has been identified by 9.5 and 140 GHz EPR spectroscopy on isotopically labeled varieties of the protein to be a thiosulfuranyl radical [RSSR₂]•, composed of a cysteine thiyl radical stabilized by an interaction with a methionine residue. The presence of a stable radical species on the reaction pathway rationalizes the previously reported [³H]-(kcat/KM) isotope effect of 2.3 with [³H]-formate, requiring formate to exchange between the active site and solution during nucleotide reduction. Analogies with the disulfide anion radical proposed to provide the reducing equivalent to the 3′-keto-deoxycytidine intermediate by the class I and II RNRs provide further evidence for the involvement of thiyl radicals in the reductive half-reaction catalyzed by all RNRs.","tags":null,"title":"A Chemically Competent Thiosulfuranyl Radical on the Escherichia coli Class III Ribonucleotide Reductase","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"This article for the Chinese programming journal 程序员 (The Programmer) is probably the longest single piece of writing in Mandarin I have ever undertaken.\nReproduced here is the draft contained in a gist.\n ","date":1393632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393632000,"objectID":"9fb42299d7db11d4c65fb2500169757c","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2014-p/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:19.463156Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2014-p/","section":"publication","summary":"Julia 是个灵活动态的语言，最初是针对数值计算而发明的。创始先驱有杰夫·贝桑松（Jeff Bezanson）、斯特凡·卡平斯基（Stefan Karpinski）、威拉尔·莎（Viral B.

For systems with disordered interactions, we observe a small but visible degradation of the approximation. To explain this behavior of the free approximation, we develop and apply an asymptotic error analysis scheme to show that the approximation is accurate to the eighth moment in the density of states for systems with constant interactions, but is only accurate to sixth order for systems with disordered interactions. The error analysis also allows us to calculate asymptotic corrections to the density of states, allowing for systematically improvable approximations as well as insight into the sources of error without requiring a direct comparison to an exact solution.","tags":null,"title":"Densities of states for disordered systems from free probability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lee-Ping Wang","Jiahao Chen","Daniel Tofan","Troy Van Voorhis","Christopher Cummins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380067200,"objectID":"89a5ea096bb458b9011464741c1c5692","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/wang-2013-a/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.328321Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"We report a computational study of an energetically favorable pathway for the excited-state dissociation of a tetrahedral P₄ molecule into two P₂\tmolecules via the simultaneous breaking of four chemical bonds along a highly symmetric (D2d) reaction pathway.

Thermodynamically accessible microstates were sampled explicitly from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and the structure of excitonic states were determined using a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).

However, there are an infinite number of these intersections and it is difficult to predict which are actually relevant. Furthermore, traditional descriptors such as intrinsic reaction coordinates and steepest descent paths often fail to adequately characterize excited state reactions due to their highly nonequilibrium nature. To address these deficiencies in the characterization of excited state mechanisms, we apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme (diffusion mapping) to generate reaction coordinates directly from _ab initio_ multiple spawning dynamics calculations. As illustrated with various examples of photoisomerization dynamics, excited state reaction pathways can be derived directly from simulation data without any _a priori_ specification of relevant coordinates. Furthermore, diffusion maps also reveal the influence of intersection topography on the efficiency of electronic population transfer, providing further evidence that peaked intersections promote nonadiabatic transitions more effectively than sloped intersections. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques as powerful tools for elucidating reaction mechanisms beyond the statistical description of processes on ground state potential energy surfaces","tags":null,"title":"Nonlinear dimensionality reduction for nonadiabatic dynamics: The influence of conical intersection topography on population transfer rates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1355414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1355414400,"objectID":"178188e786b6253ff4ba33c90f7c49ed","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2012-12-bu/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T21:02:44+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2012-12-bu/","section":"talk","summary":"A two-pronged computational study using both atomistic calculations and analytic models has revealed insights into how disorder affects the electrical and optical properties of organic semiconductors.

Also, QTPIE demonstrates linear-scaling polarizabilities when coupling the external electric field in a manner that treats its potential as a perturbation of the atomic electronegativities.

Chen and T. J. Martinez, Chem. Phys. Lett. 438, 315 (2007)) is a fluctuating-charge model with correct asymptotic behavior. Unlike most other fluctuating-charge models, QTPIE is formulated in terms of charge-transfer variables and pairwise electronegativities, not atomic charge variables and electronegativities. The pairwise character of the electronegativities in QTPIE avoids spurious charge transfer when bonds are broken. However, the increased number of variables leads to considerable computational expense and a rank-deficient set of working equations, which is numerically inconvenient. Here, we show that QTPIE can be exactly reformulated in terms of atomic charge variables, leading to a considerable reduction in computational complexity. The transformation between atomic and bond variables is generally applicable to arbitrary fluctuating charge models, and uncovers an underlying topological framework that can be used to understand the relation between fluctuating-charge models and the classical theory of electrical circuits.","tags":null,"title":"A unified theoretical framework for fluctuating-charge models in atom-space and in bond-space","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Todd J Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1219791600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1219791600,"objectID":"93d455c06324990f1290c0307f614a7a","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2008-08-faraday/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T21:06:09+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2008-08-faraday/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A flexible water model capable of polarization and charge-transfer","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Todd J Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1216443600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1216443600,"objectID":"a59661d2c48c0cc9158dd1a1d1a113cd","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2008-07-actc/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T21:06:16+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2008-07-actc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Toward a flexible water model capable of polarization and charge-transfer,","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Todd J Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1215565200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1215565200,"objectID":"4f327539397b0095cabf43d6d60e9400","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2008-07-qscp/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T21:06:18+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2008-07-qscp/","section":"talk","summary":"Of the available methods for treating polarization in classical molecular dynamics simulations, only fluctuating-charge models such as EEM, QEq, fluc-q and CHARMM C22 can potentially describe both charge transfer and polarization. However, these current models predict unphysical non-integer charge separation at dissociation. Also, they predict dipole polarizabilities that are not correctly sizeextensive. Our QTPIE model is a modification of QEq that describes correct charge transfer at dissociation limits for overall neutral systems. Here, we use coplanar, linear water chains to show that unlike other fluctuating-charge models, QTPIE predicts the correct direction of charge transfer. Also, we investigate the origin of the super-linear scaling of the dipole polarizabilities, and show how QTPIE can reproduce the correct scaling properties of the dipole polarizabilities and dipole moments without a priori constraints on charge transfer. Unlike other previously proposed solutions to this problem, we are able to retain a useful treatment of intermolecular charge transfer. We also show that calculations in the TINKER molecular mechanics package using QTPIE are about five times as expensive as conventional fixed-charge calculations. Finally, we report on our progress toward the development of a flexible water model that uses QTPIE to capture both polarization and charge transfer effects.","tags":[],"title":"Toward a flexible water model capable of polarization and charge-transfer","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"bdd3a37e6f6becdb901a164b1c0e8430","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2008-fd/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.016723Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2008-fd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Comments in General Discussion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1196467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1196467200,"objectID":"018e49401e0d1f39254dd4c75ea2eb40","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2007-b/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.020369Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2007-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Improving the performance of the TINKER classical molecular dynamics program while maintaining code readability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Todd J Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1187566200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1187566200,"objectID":"0c9875f2856d599843fe11977b780e7f","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2007-08-acs/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T21:04:39+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2007-08-acs/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"QTPIE: A minimal extension of Goddard’s QEq model with correct dissociation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Inmi Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1177977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177977600,"objectID":"fe62d480c301c4210b418ab726dc78c0","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2007-a/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.019493Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2007-a/","section":"publication","summary":"A finite normalized tight frame (FNTF) in a real or complex Euclidean space $$K^d (K = \\mathbb R \\textrm{ or } \\mathbb C)$$ is a Bessel sequence $$\\\\{x\\_n\\\\}^N\\_{n=1}$$ that generalizes orthonormal bases that maintains the decomposition property\n$$ y = \\frac 1 A \\sum^N\\_{n=1} \\langle y, x\\_n \\rangle x\\_n \\forall y \\in K^d$$\nwhile giving up the basis property.","tags":null,"title":"Introduction to finite normalized tight frames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Todd J Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1177027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177027200,"objectID":"dba9483324a52bd7f111a825ac16c9e7","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2007/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.324712Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"Polarization and charge transfer are important effects which are difficult to describe using conventional force fields.

In this work we model the main antenna protein of photosystem II, namely light harvesting complex II (LHC-II), with a single-exciton Hamiltonian with sites coupled via dipole-dipole interaction, with linear coupling to a dissipative phonon bath. With appropriate parameters, Monte Carlo path integral (MCPI) results of the exciton coherence length from 1 K to 500 K show that at thermodynamic equilibrium, an exciton in LHC-II is localized mostly on 2 single chlorophyll pigment sites, with persistent short-range coherence over the A2-B2 pair, A3-B3 pair and B1-B5-B6 triplet. Quasi-adiabatic path integral (QUAPI) calculations of the subsystems mentioned above show a smooth, incoherent relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. The results obtained imply that with the exception of small coherent subsystems at cryogenic temperatures, excitons in LHC-II are more localized than in the analogous light harvesting complex II (LH-II) of the purple bacterium Rs. molischianum, which may be expected from the lower symmetry of the former.","tags":null,"title":"Numerical simulations of the exciton coherence length in the photosynthetic light harvesting complex II (LHC-II) of higher plants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","David Hardy","Russell Todres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":978307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":978307200,"objectID":"64be9c32a5ac37f1c5018680c456f0f3","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2001/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.024342Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2001/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Two-dimensional Monte Carlo Simulation of Nematic Elastomers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Audi Siu-Wah Fong","Tzi-Sum Andy Hor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":910656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":910656000,"objectID":"da6e6af31620af66d577ce2551a0bb68","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-1998/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.018696Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-1998/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Synthesis of a Mixed-Metal {RuPt} Complex from a Ruthenium Cluster","type":"publication"}]
