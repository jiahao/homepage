Probabilistic models for predicting the protected class based on observable proxies, such as surname and geolocation for race, are sometimes used to impute these missing labels for compliance assessments. Empirically, these methods are observed to exaggerate disparities, but the reason why is unknown. In this paper, we decompose the biases in estimating outcome disparity via threshold-based imputation into multiple interpretable bias sources, allowing us to explain when over- or underestimation occurs. We also propose an alternative weighted estimator that uses soft classification, and show that its bias arises simply from the conditional covariance of the outcome with the true class membership. Finally, we illustrate our results with numerical simulations and a public dataset of mortgage applications, using geolocation as a proxy for race. We confirm that the bias of threshold-based imputation is generally upward, but its magnitude varies strongly with the threshold chosen. Our new weighted estimator tends to have a negative bias that is much simpler to analyze and reason about.","tags":null,"title":"Fairness under unawareness: assessing disparity when protected class is unobserved","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Nathan Kallus","Xiaojie Mao","Geoffry Svacha","Madeleine Udell"],"categories":null,"content":"My intern, Xiaojie Mao, will be presenting his summer research work while at Capital One.\n","date":1547823375,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547823375,"objectID":"cd99cfecebc73588754700e152fd4fb6","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/talk/2019-fatstar/","publishdate":"2019-01-18T09:56:15-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-fatstar/","section":"talk","summary":"My intern, Xiaojie Mao, will be presenting his summer research work while at Capital One.","tags":[],"title":"Fairness under unawareness: assessing disparity when protected class is unobserved","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jeff Bezanson","Jiahao Chen","Benjamin Chung","Stefan Karpinski","Viral B.

Neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) molecular orbital methods provide and intriguing generalization of classical force fields in this regard because they can account both for bond breaking and electronic polarization of molecules. However, we show that most standard NDDO methods fail for water because they give an incorrect description of hydrogen bonding, water's key structural feature. Using force matching, we design a reparameterized NDDO model and find that it qualitatively reproduces the experimental radial distribution function of water, as well as various monomer, dimer, and bulk properties that PM6 does not. This suggests that the apparent limitations of NDDO models are primarily due to poor parameterization and not to the NDDO approximations themselves. Finally, we identify the physical parameters that most influence the condensed phase properties. These results help to elucidate the chemistry that a semiempirical molecular orbital picture of water must capture. We conclude that properly parameterized NDDO models could be useful for simulations that require electronically detailed explicit solvent, including the calculation of redox potentials and simulation of charge transfer and photochemistry.","tags":null,"title":"Why many semiempirical molecular orbital theories fail for liquid water and how to fix them","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Alan Edelman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1416182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1416182400,"objectID":"ed6c1a41f35cc471c1c0a98a4fb0e9df","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2014/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:19.627708Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Polymorphism in programming languages enables code reuse.

Defining this functionality at the user level instead provides greater flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility. In contrast, dynamic languages make it straightforward for the user to define any behavior they might want, but at the possible expense of performance. As part of the Julia language project, we have developed an approach that yields a novel trade-off between flexibility and compile-time analysis. The core abstraction we use is multiple dispatch. We have come to believe that while multiple dispatch has not been especially popular in most kinds of programming, technical computing is its killer application. By expressing key functions such as array indexing using multi-method signatures, a surprising range of behaviors can be obtained, in a way that is both relatively easy to write and amenable to compiler analysis. The compact factoring of concerns provided by these methods makes it easier for user-defined types to behave consistently with types in the standard library.","tags":null,"title":"Array operators using multiple dispatch: a design methodology for array implementations in dynamic languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifeng Wei","Guinevere Mathies","Kenichi Yokoyama","Jiahao Chen","Robert G.

Unlike the class I and II RNRs, where reducing equivalents for the reaction are delivered by a redoxin (thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, or NrdH) via a pair of conserved active site cysteines, the class III RNRs examined to date use formate as the reductant. Here, we report that reaction of the _Escherichia coli_ class III RNR with CTP (substrate) and ATP (allosteric effector) in the absence of formate leads to loss of the G• concomitant with stoichiometric formation of a new radical species and a “trapped” cytidine derivative that can break down to cytosine. Addition of formate to the new species results in recovery of 80% of the G• and reduction of the cytidine derivative, proposed to be 3′-keto-deoxycytidine, to dCTP and a small amount of cytosine. The structure of the new radical has been identified by 9.5 and 140 GHz EPR spectroscopy on isotopically labeled varieties of the protein to be a thiosulfuranyl radical [RSSR₂]•, composed of a cysteine thiyl radical stabilized by an interaction with a methionine residue. The presence of a stable radical species on the reaction pathway rationalizes the previously reported [³H]-(kcat/KM) isotope effect of 2.3 with [³H]-formate, requiring formate to exchange between the active site and solution during nucleotide reduction. Analogies with the disulfide anion radical proposed to provide the reducing equivalent to the 3′-keto-deoxycytidine intermediate by the class I and II RNRs provide further evidence for the involvement of thiyl radicals in the reductive half-reaction catalyzed by all RNRs.","tags":null,"title":"A Chemically Competent Thiosulfuranyl Radical on the Escherichia coli Class III Ribonucleotide Reductase","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"This article for the Chinese programming journal 程序员 (The Programmer) is probably the longest single piece of writing in Mandarin I have ever undertaken.\nReproduced here is the draft contained in a gist.\n ","date":1393632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393632000,"objectID":"9fb42299d7db11d4c65fb2500169757c","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2014-p/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:19.463156Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2014-p/","section":"publication","summary":"Julia 是个灵活动态的语言，最初是针对数值计算而发明的。创始先驱有杰夫·贝桑松（Jeff Bezanson）、斯特凡·卡平斯基（Stefan Karpinski）、威拉尔·莎（Viral B.

For systems with disordered interactions, we observe a small but visible degradation of the approximation. To explain this behavior of the free approximation, we develop and apply an asymptotic error analysis scheme to show that the approximation is accurate to the eighth moment in the density of states for systems with constant interactions, but is only accurate to sixth order for systems with disordered interactions. The error analysis also allows us to calculate asymptotic corrections to the density of states, allowing for systematically improvable approximations as well as insight into the sources of error without requiring a direct comparison to an exact solution.","tags":null,"title":"Densities of states for disordered systems from free probability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lee-Ping Wang","Jiahao Chen","Daniel Tofan","Troy Van Voorhis","Christopher Cummins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380067200,"objectID":"89a5ea096bb458b9011464741c1c5692","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/wang-2013-a/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.328321Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"We report a computational study of an energetically favorable pathway for the excited-state dissociation of a tetrahedral P₄ molecule into two P₂\tmolecules via the simultaneous breaking of four chemical bonds along a highly symmetric (D2d) reaction pathway.

However, there are an infinite number of these intersections and it is difficult to predict which are actually relevant. Furthermore, traditional descriptors such as intrinsic reaction coordinates and steepest descent paths often fail to adequately characterize excited state reactions due to their highly nonequilibrium nature. To address these deficiencies in the characterization of excited state mechanisms, we apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme (diffusion mapping) to generate reaction coordinates directly from _ab initio_ multiple spawning dynamics calculations. As illustrated with various examples of photoisomerization dynamics, excited state reaction pathways can be derived directly from simulation data without any _a priori_ specification of relevant coordinates. Furthermore, diffusion maps also reveal the influence of intersection topography on the efficiency of electronic population transfer, providing further evidence that peaked intersections promote nonadiabatic transitions more effectively than sloped intersections.

We present the charge transfer with polarization current equilibration (QTPIE) model, which solves this problem by introducing distance-dependent electronegativities. A graph-theoretic analysis of the topology of charge transfer allows us to relate the fundamental quantities of charge transfer back to the more familiar variables that represent atomic partial charges. This allows us to formulate a unified theoretical framework for fluctuating-charge models and topological charge descriptors. We also demonstrate the important role of charge screening effects in obtaining correct size extensivity in electrostatic properties. Analyzing the spatial symmetries of these properties allows us to shed light on the role of charge conservation in the electronegativity equalization process. Finally, we develop a water model for use in classical molecular dynamics simulations that is capable of treating both polarization and charge transfer phenomena.","tags":null,"title":"Theory and applications of fluctuating-charge models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Todd J Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1229299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1229299200,"objectID":"24c268c945f9e684691fe7e82af54df6","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2008121544/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.01804Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2008121544/","section":"publication","summary":"Fluctuating-charge models have been used to model polarization effects in molecular mechanics methods.

Also, QTPIE demonstrates linear-scaling polarizabilities when coupling the external electric field in a manner that treats its potential as a perturbation of the atomic electronegativities.

Unlike most other fluctuating-charge models, QTPIE is formulated in terms of charge-transfer variables and pairwise electronegativities, not atomic charge variables and electronegativities. The pairwise character of the electronegativities in QTPIE avoids spurious charge transfer when bonds are broken. However, the increased number of variables leads to considerable computational expense and a rank-deficient set of working equations, which is numerically inconvenient. Here, we show that QTPIE can be exactly reformulated in terms of atomic charge variables, leading to a considerable reduction in computational complexity. The transformation between atomic and bond variables is generally applicable to arbitrary fluctuating charge models, and uncovers an underlying topological framework that can be used to understand the relation between fluctuating-charge models and the classical theory of electrical circuits.","tags":null,"title":"A unified theoretical framework for fluctuating-charge models in atom-space and in bond-space","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"bdd3a37e6f6becdb901a164b1c0e8430","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2008-fd/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.016723Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2008-fd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Comments in General Discussion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1196467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1196467200,"objectID":"018e49401e0d1f39254dd4c75ea2eb40","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2007-b/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.020369Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2007-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Improving the performance of the TINKER classical molecular dynamics program while maintaining code readability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Inmi Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1177977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177977600,"objectID":"fe62d480c301c4210b418ab726dc78c0","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2007-a/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.019493Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2007-a/","section":"publication","summary":"A finite normalized tight frame (FNTF) in a real or complex Euclidean space $$K^d (K = \\mathbb R \\textrm{ or } \\mathbb C)$$ is a Bessel sequence $$\\\\{x\\_n\\\\}^N\\_{n=1}$$ that generalizes orthonormal bases that maintains the decomposition property\n$$ y = \\frac 1 A \\sum^N\\_{n=1} \\langle y, x\\_n \\rangle x\\_n \\forall y \\in K^d$$\nwhile giving up the basis property.","tags":null,"title":"Introduction to finite normalized tight frames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiahao Chen","Todd J Martínez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1177027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177027200,"objectID":"dba9483324a52bd7f111a825ac16c9e7","permalink":"https://jiahao.github.io/publication/chen-2007/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T10:13:20.324712Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2007/","section":"publication","summary":"Polarization and charge transfer are important effects which are difficult to describe using conventional force fields.

Quasi-adiabatic path integral (QUAPI) calculations of the subsystems mentioned above show a smooth, incoherent relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium.
