UROPs are available for academic credit  or on a volunteer basis .  How to apply  Please contact Dr.  Jiahao Chen , Prof.  Alan\nEdelman  and Prof.  Steven G.\nJohnson  to discuss eligibility and available\nprojects.  Proposals should be submitted through the  UROP\nwebsite .  The MIT UROP office accepts applications several times per year.\nThe deadline for spring and fall semesters is the first Friday of the first\nweek of classes.
