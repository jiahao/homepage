@article{Chen2008a,
abstract = {We have recently developed the QTPIE (charge transfer with polarization current equilibration) fluctuating-charge model, a new model with correct dissociation behavior for nonequilibrium geometries. The correct asymptotics originally came at the price of representing the solution in terms of charge-transfer variables instead of atomic charges. However, we have found an exact reformulation of fluctuating-charge models in terms of atomic charges again, which is made possible by the symmetries of classical electrostatics. We show how this leads to the distinction between two types of atomic electronegativities in our model. While one is a intrinsic property of individual atoms, the other takes into account the local electrical surroundings. This distinction could resolve some confusion surrounding the concept of electronegativity as to whether it is an intrinsic property of elements, or otherwise. We also use the QTPIE model to create a three-site water model and discuss simple applications.},

@article{Chen2008,
abstract = {Our previously introduced QTPIE (charge transfer with polarization current equilibration) model [J. Chen and T. J. Mart\'{\i}nez, Chem. Phys. Lett. 438, 315 (2007)] is a fluctuating-charge model with correct asymptotic behavior. Unlike most other fluctuating-charge models, QTPIE is formulated in terms of charge-transfer variables and pairwise electronegativities, not atomic charge variables and electronegativities. The pairwise character of the electronegativities in QTPIE allows us to avoid spurious charge transfer when bonds are broken. However, the increased number of variables leads to considerable computational expense and a rank-deficient set of working equations, which is numerically inconvenient. Here, we show that QTPIE can be exactly reformulated in terms of atomic charge variables, leading to a considerable reduction in computational complexity. The transformation between atomic and bond variables is generally applicable to arbitrary fluctuating charge models and uncovers an underlying topological framework that can be used to understand the relation between fluctuating-charge models and the classical theory of electrical circuits.},

	Abstract = {Arrays are such a rich and fundamental data type that they tend to be built into a language, either in the compiler or in a large low-level library. Defining this functionality at the user level instead provides greater flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility. In contrast, dynamic languages make it straightforward for the user to define any behavior they might want, but at the possible expense of performance.
As part of the Julia language project, we have developed an approach that yields a novel trade-off between flexibility and compile-time analysis. The core abstraction we use is multiple dispatch. We have come to believe that while multiple dispatch has not been especially popular in most kinds of programming, technical computing is its killer application. By expressing key functions such as array indexing using multi-method signatures, a surprising range of behaviors can be obtained, in a way that is both relatively easy to write and amenable to compiler analysis. The compact factoring of concerns provided by these methods makes it easier for user-defined types to behave consistently with types in the standard library.},
