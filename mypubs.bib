abstract = {We have recently developed the QTPIE (charge transfer with polarization current equilibration) fluctuating-charge model, a new model with correct dissociation behavior for nonequilibrium geometries. The correct asymptotics originally came at the price of representing the solution in terms of charge-transfer variables instead of atomic charges. However, we have found an exact reformulation of fluctuating-charge models in terms of atomic charges again, which is made possible by the symmetries of classical electrostatics. We show how this leads to the distinction between two types of atomic electronegativities in our model. While one is a intrinsic property of individual atoms, the other takes into account the local electrical surroundings. This distinction could resolve some confusion surrounding the concept of electronegativity as to whether it is an intrinsic property of elements, or otherwise. We also use the QTPIE model to create a three-site water model and discuss simple applications.},

@article{Chen2008,
abstract = {Our previously introduced QTPIE (charge transfer with polarization current equilibration) model [J. Chen and T. J. Mart\'{\i}nez, Chem. Phys. Lett. 438, 315 (2007)] is a fluctuating-charge model with correct asymptotic behavior. Unlike most other fluctuating-charge models, QTPIE is formulated in terms of charge-transfer variables and pairwise electronegativities, not atomic charge variables and electronegativities. The pairwise character of the electronegativities in QTPIE allows us to avoid spurious charge transfer when bonds are broken. However, the increased number of variables leads to considerable computational expense and a rank-deficient set of working equations, which is numerically inconvenient. Here, we show that QTPIE can be exactly reformulated in terms of atomic charge variables, leading to a considerable reduction in computational complexity. The transformation between atomic and bond variables is generally applicable to arbitrary fluctuating charge models and uncovers an underlying topological framework that can be used to understand the relation between fluctuating-charge models and the classical theory of electrical circuits.},
